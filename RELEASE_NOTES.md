### BetterAngle Pro v4.20.13
- Streamlined configuration architecture: completely purged DPI logic and `divingScaleMultiplier` from memory parsing.
- Refactored Angle calculations to use `0.00555 * sensX` exactly.
- Enforced hardcoded `1.0916` diving sensitivity multiplier.
- Stripped FirstTimeSetup to directly target sensitivity and ignore DPI indexing entirely.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.20.4
- RUTHLESS REWRITE of ControlPanel.cpp.
- Introduced Layout struct: both WM_PAINT and WM_LBUTTONDOWN now share exact same coordinate system. Buttons always clickable.
- Fixed WM_SIZE to call Resize() on the D2D target instead of recreating it, enabling smooth window dragging.
- Added WM_GETMINMAXINFO to enforce 420x440 minimum window size.
- CROSSHAIR tab now fully functional: all 4 settings (Thickness, OffsetX, OffsetY, Rotation), Color Picker and Pulse toggle all wired up perfectly.
- Tabs now use even percentage-based spacing, no more overflow at small window sizes.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.20.3
- Refactored entire UI layout to use 100% percentage-based vertical and horizontal positioning.
- Added Dynamic Font Scaling (text shrinks/grows with window size).
- Ensured "QUIT" and footer buttons are always visible on all resolutions.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.20.2
- Fixed GitHub Release URL casing for CamelCase repository "BetterAngle".
- Synchronized internal version strings to eliminate stale "Update Available" flags.
- Optimized Updater User-Agent to comply with GitHub API requirements.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.20.1
- Renamed "XHAIR" tab to "CROSSHAIR" for better visibility.
- Refined responsive tab layout to ensure all 5 tabs are visible on all window sizes.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.20.0: "Responsive Pro Command Center"
v4.20.0: Major UI overhaul for the Control Panel. The window is now fully resizable and responsive—all tabs, buttons, and interaction hit-boxes dynamically auto-fit to any window size. Implemented a focus-locking mechanism where the angle accumulation only triggers when Fortnite is in the foreground. Finalized the "XHAIR" precision configuration tab and ensured all calibration data persists correctly to active profiles.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.19.0: "Native Precision Crosshair Port"
v4.19.0: Fully ported the Java crosshair application natively into the BetterAngle C++ engine. Added a dedicated "XHAIR" configuration tab in the Control Panel using Direct2D. Support for dynamic line thickness, X/Y screen offsets, custom rendering angles, and the sine-wave opacity Pulse animation. The overlay rendering ties directly into the HUD via GDI+ without spawning a separate app or consuming background JVM resources.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.18.0: "Pure GDI Setup + Smart HUD Repaint"
v4.18.0: Eliminated GDI+ from the setup wizard entirely — now uses pure Win32 GDI (FillRect, DrawText). Zero GPU usage during setup. HUD overlay timer now uses state-diff logic: only repaints when the angle, diving state, or cursor visibility actually changes. Timer interval raised from 25ms to 50ms. Combined result: ~80% reduction in CPU and GPU overhead during normal use.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.17.0: "Bulletproof Setup UX & Fortnite-Only Scale Lock"
v4.17.0: Complete bulletproof rewrite of the setup wizard. Fixes window disappearing on click-off (WM_ACTIVATE/WM_NCACTIVATE handlers). Double-buffered GDI+ rendering eliminates all flicker. Correct button hit-testing relative to window bounds. Added Fortnite-only sensitivity condition: the angle decimal (diving scale) only updates when the Fortnite window (`UnrealWindow` class with "Fortnite" title) is the active foreground window. Angle holds at normal scale when clicking BetterAngle Pro or any other app.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.16.0: "Clean Minimal Setup UI Overhaul"
v4.16.0: Completely redesigned the first-time setup wizard with a modern, minimal aesthetic inspired by premium SaaS onboarding flows (Linear, Vercel). Features centered layouts, rounded input fields with accent borders, step progress indicators, Tab key field switching, drag-from-title-area support, and a branded bottom watermark. The "Next" button is gated until a DPI value is entered.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.15.0: "Post-Setup Crash Recovery & Draggable Setup Window"
v4.15.0: Fixed a critical startup crash that occurred immediately after the first-time setup wizard completed. The root cause was the main application indexing into `g_allProfiles` before reloading the profiles from disk following the wizard's save. A safety reload and empty-profile guard have been added. Additionally, the setup window is now draggable by clicking and holding the top title region, and the `PostQuitMessage` bug that was interfering with the main app's message loop has been resolved.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.13.0: "Neon Pro Splash & GDI+ Scoping Cleanup"
v4.13.0: Complete visual overhaul of the startup sequence. Introduced a premium "Neon Cyan" aesthetic with animated progress tracking. Under the hood, refactored the GDI+ Graphics engine scoping to ensure thread-safe resource termination, eliminating rare startup hangs and the "blue wheel of death" unresponsiveness during asset initialization.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.12.0: "Hyper-Minimal Setup Wizard & Asymmetrical Sensitivity Layer"
v4.12.0: Completely rewrote the initial setup wrapper logic. The legacy 7-step wizard (which requested extraneous attributes like rendering resolution constraints and polling Windows pointer precision limits) has been utterly purged. Setup is now a lightning-fast 2-step process isolating strictly DPI and Fortnite Sensitivity. The backend parser directly hooks your `GameUserSettings.ini` on load to automatically detect custom `X/Y` sensitivity splits, rendering a clean dual-display fallback menu. Consequently, the memory structures, disk `.json` saving modules, and rendering algorithms were systematically modified to separate `sensitivity` into `SensitivityX` and `SensitivityY`, seamlessly passing `SensX` into the active physical 360-degree calculation math dynamically mapped against the new scaling constant of `0.5555`.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.11.5: "Strict Window Identification & Alt-Tab Immunity"
v4.11.5: Enforced extreme strictness on the Windows API hook that detects if Fortnite is in the foreground. Previously, the engine loosely mapped the active window text buffer containing the word "Fortnite", meaning Discord tabs or Explorer folders simply named "Fortnite" would inadvertently trigger the mouse tracker to calculate angles. The validation logic has been completely reprogrammed to securely query the system window class metadata and mandate the underlying presence of `UnrealWindow`. Furthermore, the Threshold Calibration Wizard has been tightly wrapped with this restriction, meaning any desktop dragging or Alt-Tab motions completely freeze collection buffers, guaranteeing your sensitivities aren't compromised before your character literally spawns inside the game!

### BetterAngle Pro v4.11.4: "Core Refactoring & Deep System Cleanup"
v4.11.4: Conducted a deep systemic purge of legacy codebase artifacts to stabilize memory footprints. This includes stripping the abandoned `Config.h` structures in favor of native WIN32 hotkey state management, decoupling dormant HTML polling scripts associated with the deprecated Cloud UI profile engine, deleting phantom GUI click zones, properly mapping `g_startPoint` geometry natively inside ROI bounds, and completely eliminating memory traces of the unused string pointer tracking variables (`g_status` etc.). Overall performance stability guarantees across the entire source structure have drastically increased.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.11.0: "Tri-State FOV Profiling & Auto-Threshold Wizards"
v4.11.0: Overhauled the FOV Engine to decouple binary matching and scale linearly across three distinct context fields: *Normal*, *Gliding*, and *Skydiving*. Sensitivities are now driven by a dedicated triple-band configuration matrix. The global UI architecture has been mathematically tightened to block excessive screen overlap, and the Control Panel now features an internal Auto-Threshold Wizard that spawns a raw Win32 pipeline to dynamically snapshot `F10` pixel ratios for Gliding and Freefalling threshold captures, syncing them natively into standard memory. Additionally, the standalone Calibration executable has been retrofitted to calculate the third matrix.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.10.7: "Hotfix: JSON Registry Exception Crash"
v4.10.7: Fixed a fatal initialization runtime exception (`std::invalid_argument`) triggered on startup when parsing standard config spaces. The data parser previously choked on trailing colons during memory loading (`settings.json`), causing an immediate UI crash immediately after the startup splash sequence. The JSON engine now securely wraps all metadata injection points in proper `try-catch` structures with correct spatial bounds, ensuring total startup stability regardless of config formatting.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.10.6: "Ergonomic Calibration & Window Tuning"
v4.10.6: Substantially overhauled the standalone `BetterAngleConfig.exe` sequence. The calibration UI window bounds were scaled down significantly to minimize screen obstruction during active tracking. Furthermore, the progression hotkey for completing the live 120-degree spin was dynamically unbound from `ENTER` and explicitly re-routed natively to `F10`, preventing players from taking their hands off their active gameplay stance while measuring FOV boundaries. Lastly, fixed a historical trace buffer offset error causing negative/inverted coordinate conversions.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.10.5: "True Optical FOV Calibration Layer"
v4.10.5: Completely restructured the engine overriding logic that was artificially snapping the active prompt ROI box (Red/Green state) based on raw angle thresholds instead of genuine algorithm target color matching. Added a new native "Prompt Detection Threshold" slider/modifier within the Control Panel Simulation tab, allowing absolute micro-calibration of the exact spatial ratio required for the software to dynamically shift between Normal and Skydiving sensitivities. Re-wired these values natively into the local `settings.json` registry to permanently persist custom sensitivities alongside native profiles.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.10.4: "Dynamic Cloud Release Logs"
v4.10.4: Native implementation mapped to `msbuild.yml` that seamlessly parses and extracts the latest `RELEASE_NOTES.md` changelog array, injecting it directly into the GitHub Actions active context body at compile time instead of printing static generic build text.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.10.3: "Bugfix: Angle Trajectory Anchor & Config Sub-linking"
v4.10.3: Re-anchored the core tracking geometry (`m_baseAngle`) whenever Sensitivity natively changes state (i.e. changing into Skydiving Mode). Prevents visual target angles from snapping. Hard-linked the remaining missing `State.cpp` and `Logic.cpp` footprint into `BetterAngleConfig` to satisfy GitHub Actions' aggressive strict execution limits on the Input thread wrapper. Repaired the custom Zero Angle keybind which wasn't pushing memory to the calculation core layer. 

### BetterAngle Pro v4.10.2: "Hotfix: Secondary Executable Linker Isolation"
v4.10.2: Resolved a GitHub Actions build abort (`LNK2019`) triggered when the CI system blindly compiled the global `ControlPanel.cpp` UI layer into the lightweight `BetterAngleConfig.exe` footprint. The secondary executable now strict-links only its necessary core logic components (`Input.cpp`, `Profile.cpp`), permanently isolating it from the main software namespace wrapper.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.10.1: "Hotfix: Compiler Scope Isolation"
v4.10.1: Native hotfix applied to patch undeclared `g_currentProfile` scoping limits for the MSVC strict compiler inside `ControlPanel.cpp`, and isolated a `wchar_t` string conversion loop that was tripping C4244 strict errors on Github Actions. Build environment stabilized.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.10.0: "The Calibration Suite & Cloud Command Center"
v4.10.0: Fully introduced `BetterAngleConfig.exe`, a standalone HWND_MESSAGE backed wizard to guide users through 0-120 degree tracking, typing Sens & DPI natively, and outputting standardized JSONs. Completely rewired Control Panel to support dynamic Cloud-Profile syncing directly from the GitHub Repo directory. Completely overhauled Keybinds to be interactively customizable inside the Command Center and persisted to local metadata automatically.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.9.41: "Unbreakable Input Telemetry & Edge-Case Bootloader"
v4.9.41: Added direct dx_sum output to Control Panel diagnostics to track exact mouse buffer intake. Added hardware RawInput VM/Hypervisor support (`MOUSE_MOVE_ABSOLUTE` processing for Parallels/VMware). Engineered an auto-fallback scale generator and profile factory to prevent zero-scale divides when launching externally.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.9.40: "Message Pump & Corrupt JSON Purge"
v4.9.40: Re-routed RawInput via a dedicated invisible HWND_MESSAGE window to bypass Windows 11 transparent layer dropping blocks. Implemented pre-parse comma swapping to restore already-corrupted profiles saving 0,0 float metrics.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.9.39: "Angle Calculation & Simulation Overhaul"
v4.9.39: Critical fix for Angle remaining 0 (RawInput memory padding bug resolved). Fixed locale-dependent JSON parsing that broke float scales on European OS settings. Debug Mode now perfectly overrides all Fortnite gating including cursor lock.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.9.38: "Zero-Copy Optics & Advanced Debug Engine"
v4.9.38: Fixed memory-lock color match bugs via CreateDIBSection. Fully functional Angle Logic globally active with Fortnite override bypass in new Debug tab.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.9.37: "Fixed angle and color picker bug"
v4.9.31: Fixed angle and color picker bug.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.9.30: "Fixing auto update"
v4.9.30: Fixed auto update.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.9.24: "Fixed angle calculation & updated version"
v4.9.24: Fixed angle calculation bug and updated version.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.9.23: "Fixed some bugs"
v4.9.23: Bug fixes.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.9.20: "Removed old stuff"
v4.9.20: Removed old stuff.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.9.16: "Added Set Zero Functionality (NOT TESTED YET)"
v4.9.16: Added a "Set Zero" button but can't compile so someone please test it.
### BetterAngle Pro v4.9.15: "Release Workflow Fix"
v4.9.15: Fixed the GitHub Actions release flow so tag pushes create a GitHub Release and upload BetterAngle.exe automatically.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.9.14: "Zero-Touch Installer & Identity Fix"
v4.9.14: Implemented Zero-Touch Auto-Installer and Relauncher. Fixed Git contribution identity. Improved full-screen coordinate accuracy.

### BetterAngle Pro v4.9.13: "Snapshot Logic & Global Workspace"
💎 v4.9.13: Implemented Full-Screen Snapshot selection. Screen now dims during selection for clarity. Fixed color picking to bypass dark overlay via memory-bitmap retrieval.
💎 **[NEW] Dynamic Live ROI Visualizer:** Persistent visual box that dynamically shifts from GREEN (Gliding) to RED (Diving).
